# MidPoint CodeGen

MidPoint CodeGen is a code generation tool designed to simplify the development of midPoint/ConnId connectors by automating repetitive tasks and reducing boilerplate code. This tool enables developers to focus on implementing critical connector functionality instead of writing verbose boilerplate like `ObjectClassInfoBuilder` and `ConnectorObjectBuilder`.

## Features
- **Annotation Processing:** Automatically generates code based on annotations for connector models.
- **Efficient Code Generation:** Reduces boilerplate by simplifying repetitive tasks.
- **Maven Integration:** Provides seamless integration into existing Maven-based projects.
- **Customizable Policies:** Enables configurable reporting policies for unsupported types and missing getters.

## Usage
### Adding the CodeGen to Your Project
To use the tool in your own project:
1. Annotate your connector classes with `@ConnectorModel` to specify the connector structure.
2. Configure the Maven plugin to include the code generation process.

Sample `pom.xml` configuration:
```xml
<plugin>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
    <configuration>
        <annotationProcessorPaths>
            <path>
                <groupId>dev.kolacek.midpoint.codegen</groupId>
                <artifactId>annotation-processor</artifactId>
                <version>0.1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
            </path>
        </annotationProcessorPaths>
    </configuration>
</plugin>
```
